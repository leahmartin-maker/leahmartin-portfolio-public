# My Learning Standards
- **Standard:** Use CSS Grid/Flexbox only (no Bootstrap).
- **Accessibility:** Always include `aria-label` and `alt` tags; I need to learn 'A11y' for my portfolio.
- **Backend Prep:** When I write HTML, suggest how I might later turn it into a dynamic component (like React or Vue).
- **Documentation:** Every time you generate code, include a "Real World Context" section explaining how this would be used in a professional tech company.
- **Code Quality:** Emphasize clean, maintainable code with comments explaining complex sections.
