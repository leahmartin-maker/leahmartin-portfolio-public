# Environmental Threats & Human Impact – TurtleExplorer

## Plastic Pollution
- Over 50% of sea turtles have eaten plastic, mistaking it for food like jellyfish.
- Ingesting plastic can block a turtle’s gut, causing starvation or death.
- Plastic bags, straws, and balloons are especially dangerous for turtles.

## Fishing Gear (Bycatch)
- Thousands of turtles die each year after being accidentally caught in fishing nets and lines.
- Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) help turtles escape from shrimp nets.
- Discarded fishing line and hooks can entangle and injure turtles.

## Boat Strikes
- Fast-moving boats can injure or kill turtles at the surface.
- Many turtles come up for air and are vulnerable to propellers.

## Coastal Development
- Building on beaches destroys nesting sites and makes it harder for turtles to lay eggs.
- Bright lights from buildings can confuse hatchlings, leading them away from the ocean.

## Climate Change
- Warmer sand temperatures can affect the sex of hatchlings (hotter sand = more females).
- Rising sea levels and storms can wash away nests.

## Oil Spills
- Oil can coat turtle skin and shells, making it hard to swim and breathe.
- Ingesting oil is toxic and can kill turtles.

## Us (Humans)
- Littering, leaving trash on beaches, and disturbing nests all harm turtles.
- Collecting turtle eggs or harassing turtles is illegal and dangerous for populations.
- Conservation efforts (like beach cleanups and nest protection) make a big difference!
