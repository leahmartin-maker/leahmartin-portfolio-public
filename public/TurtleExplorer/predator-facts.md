# Sea Turtle Predator Facts – TurtleExplorer

## Sharks
- Sharks are the main natural predator of adult sea turtles.
- Tiger sharks and great white sharks are especially known for eating turtles.
- Sharks use powerful jaws to crush turtle shells.
- Most attacks happen in open water, not near the shore.

## Killer Whales (Orcas)
- Killer whales are rare but powerful predators of sea turtles, especially in colder waters.
- Orcas can flip turtles to eat their softer undersides.
- They hunt in groups and are highly intelligent.

## Birds
- Birds like gulls and frigatebirds prey on hatchling turtles as they cross the beach.
- Many hatchlings are eaten before reaching the ocean, but this is part of the natural cycle.
- Birds spot hatchlings from the air and swoop down to grab them.

## Raccoons
- Raccoons are a major threat to turtle eggs and hatchlings on nesting beaches.
- They dig up nests to eat eggs, especially where humans have disturbed natural habitats.
- Raccoons are most active at night.

## Crabs
- Ghost crabs and other beach crabs eat turtle hatchlings and sometimes eggs.
- Crabs are both predators and important scavengers in the beach ecosystem.
- Hatchlings must race to the ocean to avoid being caught.

## Large Fish
- Groupers, snappers, and other large fish may eat hatchling turtles in shallow water.
- Most adult turtles are too big for fish to eat.
