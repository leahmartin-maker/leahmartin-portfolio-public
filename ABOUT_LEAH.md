## 📚 Learning Style (CRITICAL FOR AI ASSISTANTS)

### Teaching Approach Requirements
1. **Always explain WHY before HOW** - Context before code
2. **Use artist/muralist metaphors** when possible (e.g., "layers" for z-index)
3. **One step at a time** with confirmation between steps
4. **Ask user to explain concepts back** to verify understanding
5. **Never just implement** - always teach the reasoning
6. **Celebrate** when she identifies problems or suggests solutions independently

### What Works
- Breaking complex tasks into logical, actionable steps
- Clear explanations of technical decisions
- Relating code concepts to art concepts
- Iterative refinement with testing between changes
- Showing real-world professional context ("How would this be used at a tech company?")

### What Doesn't Work
- Jumping straight to code without explanation
- Assuming prior knowledge
- Moving too fast without confirmation
- Skipping the "why" behind decisions

## 🗣️ Elevator Pitch (for Networking)

*"I'm a creative developer learning to build interactive web experiences. I actually started as a muralist - I've painted public art all over Aransas Pass - and I wanted a better way to showcase my work online. So I taught myself React and built an interactive map where people can explore my murals. Turns out I love coding as much as I love painting."*

### Follow-Up Talking Points
- **Tech Stack:** "Next.js with React for the framework, Mapbox for the interactive map, and Tailwind for styling. I deployed it on Vercel so it auto-updates whenever I push to GitHub."
- **Hardest Part:** "Making it mobile-responsive. I had to learn about media queries and CSS positioning to make the map sidebar work as a floating card on phones but stay fixed on desktop. Also figuring out z-index layers for the animations."
- **What's Next:** "I want to add augmented reality features to some of my murals - so people can scan a QR code at the physical location and see digital overlays or animations. Bridging physical and digital art."

---

## 💬 Communication Style

### Preferences
- **Direct and concise** for simple questions
- **Detailed explanations** for complex problems
- **Real-world context** for technical decisions ("How would a professional developer approach this?")
- **Honest about challenges** - doesn't pretend to know everything
- **Iterative feedback** - tests, reports back, refines

### Working Style
- Tests changes immediately after implementation
- Provides specific feedback ("the bubbles are still transparent")
- Asks clarifying questions when confused
- Suggests improvements based on vision
- Celebrates when things work ("looks great!")

## 📝 Recent Session Summary (Jan 15-16, 2026)

### Work Completed
1. Added 3 center bubbles to mobile for organic layout (9 total on mobile vs 8 on desktop)
2. Built swipeable photo gallery modal with touch gestures
3. Enhanced bubble realism: thin iridescent borders, glassy highlights, subtle depth
4. Optimized bubble sizing (desktop 145-200px, mobile 105-140px)
5. Attempted fisheye distortion (learned CSS limitations, removed for clean approach)
6. Final bubble styling: 1px white border with pink/blue glow, radial highlight, 98% photo opacity

### Technical Lessons Learned
- CSS `transform: scale()` doesn't create true fisheye - just enlarges
- True distortion requires SVG filters, Canvas, or WebGL
- Simple is often better - clean glassy effect beats complex distortion
- Layer-based debugging effective for nested scroll issues
- `lg:hidden` class useful for mobile-only features

### User Feedback Patterns
- Iterative refinement: "way more fisheyed" → multiple attempts → "let's remove the attempt"
- Clear preferences: "i liked it before better, just not so intense"
- Specific observations: "the 3 you added are HUGE"
- Direct corrections: "you are changing the desktop. you never should have..."

## 🎨 Design Aesthetic

### Visual Style
- Ocean-inspired color palette (turquoise, coral, sunset tones)
- Organic, flowing animations (swimming turtles, floating bubbles)
- Realistic effects (iridescent bubble borders, glassy highlights)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean, accessible interfaces

### Animation Philosophy
- Subtle and elegant over flashy
- Natural movement patterns (wobble, drift, fade)
- Timed reveals for "wow factor" without overwhelming
- Organic clustering (bubbles in center) vs rigid patterns
